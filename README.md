Official Unity SDK to connect to the [User Hook](http://userhook.com) platform.

## Getting Started

To use the demo application or integrate the SDK into your own mobile app, you will first need to [sign up](https://apps.userhook.com/register) for an account and create an Application record in admin webpage.

Once you have created your Application, you will need your Application Id and Application Key found on the Application settings webpage. These values will be used to initialize the SDK inside your mobile application.


## Install the SDK in Your Mobile App

Instructions on how to integrate the User Hook SDK into your mobile application can be found in the [documentation](http://userhook.com/docs).
